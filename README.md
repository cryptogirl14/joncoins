Joncoins Scammed me for Bitcoin www.joncoins.com

My name is Rebecca and I would like to tell you about my horrible experience with www.joncoins.com

I came across this site via a Telegram group when a member shared an article from them.

I went on the site which was rather sleek and nice looking, with a lot of attractive mining contract packages where they sell numerous GPUs for Bitcoin Mining.

I added a GTX card to my cart and checked out, sent BTC to the designated address and have never heard anything back to this day.

This happened a month ago and I lost 659$ that I can’t recover.

I go to the site now and the shop is completely gone, I don’t know what do to.

Please stay away from these scammers www.joncoins.com
